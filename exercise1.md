Java

I would use checkstyle to enforce coding standards. It has predefined configs that are pretty good in making your code readable and acceptable. I found that many people use JUnit since it is effective and easy to use. This is to make sure our code works the way we want it everytime. JUnit is also very popular in the community so it is probably well documented and we can find the solutions to most issues. I would also use maven since it is relatively easy to use especially for smaller projects. This takes care of the building part of our code. It also makes adding libraries to our project easier and organized. It decreases the complications by making the process streamlined and simple. I would use Circle CI to set up my CI since it can be configured to many environments and highly configurable and customizable to our needs. It would depend highly on our needs and type of application. but from the information given, I think a cloud based-option would be ideal. It would help to not spend so much on the hardware it is much simpler to rely on the infreastrucutre provided by cloud-based solutions. It is also much simpler to configure.
